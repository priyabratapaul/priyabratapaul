## My Recent Projects

- **[Search JSON](https://search-json.vercel.app)**:
	- It is a query tool designed for exploring, querying, and transforming complex JSON data. 
	- Whether you are debugging an API response or extracting specific fields from a massive dataset, Search JSON provides an immersive, themed environment to get the job done.
	- Your JSON Data remains private. Data processing is done in client side (that is in your browser) only. Nothing goes to any backend server. So no worry on privacy issue. 


- **[NovaDAV](https://novadav.vercel.app/)**: 
    - It is a lightweight, modern, and aesthetic web interface for CalDAV and CardDAV servers. 
    - Built for users who value privacy, speed, and clean design. 
    - It allows you to manage your calendars and contacts directly from your browser without intermediate servers.
